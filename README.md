# EmployeeSQL

This repo contains all work having to do with the EmployeeSQL challenge for Data Analytics camp. The folder "EmployeeSQL" contains: a SQL file that pulls 6 csv files into a data base, SQL file to makee views based on a variety of information, ERD image of tables and how they relate,  and ERD code from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com, and a jupyter notebook file with the bonus. All the original csv's are in the "Data" folder and all the work I used to build up to the final files are contained in the "working_files" folder.

To pull the database into jupyter notebook, you will need to make a .env file with your password for PGAdmin.
